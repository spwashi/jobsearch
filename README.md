## About me
\<I think in concepts\>;
\<I wrote a programming language (github(spwashi(spw-parser))\>;
\<I can learn your language if given the time to\>;
\<last year I was fired for "deliberate poor work performance" from a Site Stabilization Team\>[on a team that had lost two thirds of its members; at a company that had a CEO and CTO step down; two weeks before my scheduled 90 day review; one week after my ADHD screening appointment;];
\<I am optimizing this job search for speed\>[the rest of the job can be learned on the job; last year I was interviewed for 5 months but did not remain employed at either job for longer than 90 days; my design skills are displayed on my instagram account, my engineering skills are displayed on my github account]
